                    <p> Horror is an interesting genre because it makes a person feel certain ways and react to those feelings. The things leading up to the scary moment builds up the person's fear, which makes them more vulnerable to being scared. Common examples of build ups are long periods of silence then being followed by a sudden loud noise, slow camera transitions and eerie sounds. </p>

                        <p> Some people aren't easily scared as others though. It all depends on the room the person is in and how loud they're watching the movie or if they're alone. Scary stories are also a good way to frighten someone since you have to get inside their minds. Creepypasta is a collection of horror stories submitted by people and Youtube contains various horror videos.  </p>
